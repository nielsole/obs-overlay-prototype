# Open Bike Sensor Video Overlay

This repo helps with overlaying information on top of a video feed given a CSV generated by OpenBikeSensor

**Current state: Untested proof of concept**

Features which I played with:
* Overlaying debug info onto video
* Align video and CSV in the following order of precedence:
  * manual input
  * autodetected QR code
  * camera metadata
  * just assume data and video start at the same time
* Overlay fancy graph e.g. for speed (I am no designer and it turned out ugly, currently commented out) 

## Installation

Currently only works on Linux. Other operating systems should easily be supportable (e.g. after hardcoded fonts are taken out)
```
pip install -r requirements
```

## Usage

1. Generate the overlay frames with the `main.py` script.
2. Run ffmpeg to overlay the generated frames onto the original video(see Makefile)
